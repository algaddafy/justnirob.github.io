					<h2>
					
					My interest in computer science began around three years ago when I first came into contact with computer coding in my brother's home while he was creating a small website. From there on, I was captivated. I started working on small projects of my own, creating other websites and a making a linux FTP server. I have learned small pieces of codes from several languages through the Lynda's lectures that are available online freely as well as through other. For me, working on computer code is my way of being creative, since I find it difficult to be creative in more common ways such as drawing. Every time I write a piece of computer code, I get the feeling I have created a piece of art and reading computer code, to me, feels like looking at a piece of art.
					<br>
					<br>
					I hope that I have been able to convince you of my excellent capabilities and my passionate motivation to start studying computer science and engineering at United International University. I really look forward to learn something new and creative from this University!
